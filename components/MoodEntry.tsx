/**
 * MoodEntry
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * A mood-based onboarding/entry UI for your Flourish chatbot.
 *
 * UX flow:
 * 1) User selects a mood bubble (e.g., Stressed, Sad/Lonely, Stuck, Motivated, Curious).
 * 2) We show an empathetic intro + 3‚Äì5 related conversation starters.
 * 3) Clicking a starter triggers `onStartConversation(prompt)` so you can
 *    prefill/send the message to your chat system.
 *
 * Props you provide:
 * - onStartConversation: (text: string) => void    // send prompt to chat
 * - onSelectEmotion?: (moodId: string) => void     // optional analytics hook
 * - className?: string                             // layout/styling wrapper
 * - initialMoodId?: string                         // preselect a mood
